FLEXBOX

º display: flex 
allow to position entities of a list in a single line side by side
flex: occupies teh whole screen
inline flex: occupies only as much as we need (the lenght of the word)

° flex-direction
decides if we are going to stack entities of a list in a line (row, by default) or in a collum (collum)

° flex-basis
decides the height (in case flex-direction: collum) or width (in case flex-direction: row) of the collum/row

° order
ints possible to change the order of the entities , 0 is default, applying 1 to a specific entitie it will be deaLlocated to the end
to creat an order we can use 1, 2, 3,...

° flex-wrap:
by default is nowrap wich makes the items go off screen
setting to wrap makes the items appear in the bass line 

° justify-content:
similar to the right, left and center 
by default is flex-start
position all intems to left (flex-start) or to the right (flex-end) or to the center (center)
we can also use space-between, space evenly and space-evenly wich creates spaces between the items

° align-items
just like justify-content, but in the y axis

°algin-self
used to change a single item
