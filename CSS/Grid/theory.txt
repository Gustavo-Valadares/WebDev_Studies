°display: grid
allow us to use grid

°grid-template-columns: 
we use to set the columns scale 
if we set grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; we'll have a first 100px column and a second 200px column
we can also set the pixels directly

°grid-template-columns: minmax(400px, 800px)
decides the minimun and the max a column can shrink and stretch 

°grid-template-columns: repeat(2x, 200px)
we use to set the amount and size of the columns

°grid-auto-row:
decides the size of new grid items that get inserted

°grid-template-row:
same thing, but for rows

°grid-template: 100px 200px / 400px 800px
another faster way of setting grid

°adding auto
makes the div automaticaly resposive, expand enough to fill the space and shrinks 

°for sizing and responsiveness
ppbrewery.github.io/grid-sizing

°grid-column: span 2
sets how much of the grip a item occupies, span 2 means the widht of the intem goes from the grid 1 to 3

°grid-column-start: & grid-column-enf:
sets the beginning and the end of the item in the grid

°order:
by default all items have 0 set as order, by setting an item's order to 1 it goes to the end of the grid
settingby -1 it goes to the beginning

°grid-area:
accepts four values separated by slashes: grid-row-start,
grid-column-start, grid-row-end, followed by grid-column-end.
